# [JSL01] Submission: Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge


# Project Overview
The Overview of the project was a simple solution based code project with simple DOM manipulation, that required us to find the solution to the problem of having to validate the syntax when users search for specific pets on the pet adoption agency's website. This required us to edit the script.js file in the provided starter code and include the code that would validate the used syntax, in order to practice basic string manipulation and validation in JavaScript.  

# Project Brief
The project brief is to create a JavaScript function that checks if the user has entered valid pet adoption details. Write a function that takes a string as input and validates if it follows a specific syntax, such as starting with "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers. If the input follows the syntax, it must return "Valid Syntax," otherwise, return "Invalid Syntax."

# Elements included 
- Modified JavaScript to validate pet adoption details syntax.
- GitHub repository containing the updated code files.

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
I wouldn't say that I have any areas that I have mastered, but I do understand the specific JavaScript syntax better. 

### Challenges faced 
One of the main challenges I faced was following the syntax that's associated with JavaScript, as well as the various routes that one can take to arrive at the same solution. I struggled with trying to decipher which functions would suffice, only to realise that several combinations of functions can produce the same result. 

### Areas of Improvement 
An area of improvement that I would like to focus on, especially on future projects (which will require more), is finding better ways to write more elegant lines of code that reduce clutter and unnecessary lines of code.

## Overall learning experience
My overall experience was quite overwhelming as I was only beginning to understand the little intricacies of writing JavaScript code and all the vast ways to do it. The experience was not on the posistive side, even though I was able to figure out how to do complete the brief. I'd give the overall project a personal rating of 6/10
